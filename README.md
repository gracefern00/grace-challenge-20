## Installation
1. Clone the Repo
2. Install dependancies
3. Run app locally
4. Run Cypress Component Tests

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express (or similar)
- **Testing**: Cypress (Component Testing)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: Render

## Features
- Cypress **component tests run** automatically when a **Pull Request** is made to the `develop` branch.
- App is **automatically deployed** to **Render** when changes are **merged into the `main` branch**.
- Ensures clean, reliable, and test-passing code is released to production.
